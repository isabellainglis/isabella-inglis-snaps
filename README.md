# Snaps

Project guidelines:
You have been approached by an entrepreneur to build out a prototype for a new photo sharing application called Snaps. The entrepreneur has meetings lined up for funding with several VCs and needs the prototype built within the next three weeks. Snapsâ€™ Creative Director has provided you with a package and mockup of how they envision the final product. There is also a separate team that is currently working on a backend API needed to integrate with the front-end, but for the time being the static function components need to be put together.

It will be your job to create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.
